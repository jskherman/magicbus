        <p>
            This is a new website, and it's going to be great.
            Feel this moment, feel it in your bones.
            Just you wait and see.
            We're still in the brainstorming phase, but we're going to have a lot of fun.
        </p>

            For now, we're handwriting the HTML, but hopefully we're going to switch to a static site generator soon.
            There's a lot of incompatible stuff with CSS3 and missing features in HTML++, so we're going to have to work
            around that.
            Links to other subpages won't probably be clickable.

            Moreover, head on over to <a href="buss://register.it>">register.it</a> to get your own domain.
            As well as to <a href="buss://dingle.it">dingle.it</a> for the search engine.
            The links for WebX references are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiOtinFFfk8">YouTube video</a> by FaceDev about the
                project.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://github.com/face-hh/webx">GitHub repository</a>where the source code and some
                documentation live.</li>
            <li>The <a href="https://facedev.gitbook.io/bussin-web-x-how-to-make-a-website">website for the
                    Documentation</a> where things are discused in more depth.</li>
        </ul>

            P.S. I am her-man fr fr. The domain says so as well. And this is irrefutable proof.

            P.S.S. I am not a robot.
