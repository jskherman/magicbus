            This is a new website, and it's going to be great.
            Feel this moment, feel it in your bones.
            Just you wait and see.
            We're still in the brainstorming phase, but we're going to have a lot of fun.

            For now, we're handwriting the HTML, but hopefully we're going to switch to a static site generator soon.
            There's a lot of incompatible stuff with CSS3 and missing features in HTML++, so we're going to have to work
            around that.
            Links to other subpages won't probably be clickable.
